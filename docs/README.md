# Pie Galaxy

A GOG client for RetroPie and other GNU/Linux distributions. It uses [Wyvern](https://github.com/nicohman/wyvern/) to download and [Innoextract](https://github.com/dscharrer/innoextract) to extract games. Pie Galaxy also provides a user interface navigable by game controllers and will install games in such a way that it will use native runtimes. It also uses Wyvern to let you claim games available from [GOG Connect](https://gog.com/connect).

Pie Galaxy does not support every game yet, and is not feature complete. And is provided without warranty.

## Contribution

There are a number of ways you can contribute.

For regular users, please file bugreports if you find any bugs. Please put in as much detail as you can. If you want to learn how Github works, maybe you can open a pull request fixing any typos in the documentation. :D

For technical users, maybe you can contribute to the exceptions list. I also welcome pull requests to the code base. Or even just code review/commenting on the code.

If you really want do do a monitary contribution, the only thing I would have a heart to accept is GOG.com gifts. If you seriously want to do a monitary contribution, you can contact me on [reddit/u/sigb](https://reddit.com/u/sigb), if you want me to work on a specific game, maybe we can do some basic information gathering before spending any money to check the feasability of getting it to work.
