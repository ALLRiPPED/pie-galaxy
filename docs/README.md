# Pie Galaxy

Pie Galaxy is a GOG client package for RetroPie and other GNU/Linux distributions.  It will download and install the platform native binary or emulated game onto a RetroPie system.

Pie Galaxy does not support every GOG game (yet!), and is not feature complete.  Pie Galaxy is provided without any warranty - use at your own enjoyment.

## Contributing

There are a number of ways you can contribute.

For regular users, please file a bug report if you find a bug. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, including RetroPie version, pi hardware version, and if possible a verbatim capture of the error message, where a copy of the text is preferred to a png of the error.

If you want to learn how Github works, maybe you can open a pull request fixing any typos in the documentation. :D

For technical users, this project needs more pull requests for the exceptions list.  I also welcome pull requests to the code base, code reviews, and even pull requests that are nothing more than a clearer comment.

If you feel the need to give a monetary contribution, the only thing I have a heart to accept are GOG.com gifts.  If you seriously want to do a monetary contribution, you can contact me on [reddit/u/sigb](https://reddit.com/u/sigb).  Contact me for specific requests to determine the feasbility of making the GOG game work, Thank You!
